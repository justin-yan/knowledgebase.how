# Concepts

My general approach to the "atomic notes" that I organize around is very similar to [Andy Matuschak's first two axioms for Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes):

1. Notes should be atomic.
2. Notes should be concept-oriented.

Roughly speaking, what this means is that the individual files/concepts/notes \(whatever you want to call them\) in my PKB are generally about a _single concept_ \(as an example, "Amino Acid"\), and are about _only_ that concept \(Proteins, which consist of Amino Acids, have their own separate note, which links to the Amino Acid note\).

However, I am not dogmatic about these rules:

* Early in a learning cycle, I will generally have very "unatomic" notes such as "Biology" which will contain a large mess of knowledge.
* I prefer to follow the dictum of "Be Useful!" when determining how many links to have or what kind of structure to use \(Associative vs. Hierarchical\)
* I'm also generally pretty accepting of _duplication_.  I've found that the same knowledge can be useful in different places, and it's _not_ necessary to attempt to "unify" them, especially if you are solving diverse and different cognitive problems.  Eliminating redundancy is sometimes a novel theoretical insight, and sometimes it's just fake work - over time, I've come to realize that it's more often the latter than I would normally guess.

However, I view those first two axioms as a useful long-term perspective on where I'd like my notes to eventually "end up", as I go through multiple rounds of deepening my knowledge and refining them.  The main reason for this is that it allows for _accretion_: over time, it remains easy to add new concepts, add new knowledge, and draw connections between potentially very disparate concepts.

### Refresh

Another heuristic I try to follow is to make sure that my PKB isn't a bad replica of Wikipedia.  Therefore, I frequently link out to external resources, but when I do choose to write about a concept directly in my PKB, I will typically write it with the idea of "refreshing knowledge" in mind.

That is, I ask myself, if I come back to a concept two years from now, having forgotten much of it, what would I want to read in order to help load the most relevant parts of that concept back into my brain as quickly as possible?

* **Primers**.  For general concepts that you need to occasionally think about, write a primer that will serve as a rapid refresh of the core ideas and trade-offs that you should consider.  Generally speaking, these are most useful when written at the level of _concepts, models_, and _techniques_ which tend to encourage a foundational understanding of the subject.

The general point being, having a folder called `Databases/` that contains everything I've ever learned about databases, while it may be useful for some _other_ cognitive problem, is probably not the best way for me to ensure I'm applying my database knowledge effectively while writing software.
